## Observer Pattern

Observer Pattern is similar to publisher - subscriber pattern. 
Obervers observe the subjects

Observer pattern is different from publisher-subscriber pattern as Observers are aware of the Subject, also the Subject maintains 
a record of the Observers. Whereas, in Publisher/Subscriber, publishers and subscribers don't need to know each other. 
They simply communicate with the help of message queues or broker
