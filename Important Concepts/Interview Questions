1) Difference between fail-fast and fail-safe iterators?
  Fail-fast iterators throw ConcurrentModificationException exception during iteration. ConcurrentModificationException is thrown when one thread is itertaing over a collection
  and other thread tries to modify ,add,delete elements in same collection.
  Fail-safe iterators doesnt throw this exception as they iterate over a clone of a collection. So they require more memory also.
  

2) Why Map is not included in collection interface?
  Map stores a key value pair where as Collections only store objects.Also map uses put(K,V) method but Collections have only add(e) method.
