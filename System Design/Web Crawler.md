# Web Crawler

- Assume 1billion web pages are downloaded each month
- Assume avg page size = 500 kb 
- Storage of 1 month = 10^9 * 500 * (10^3) = 500 10^12 = 500 TB
- Storage of 5 years = 12 * 5 * 500 TB = 30000 TB = 30 PB

Crawler should be
- Scalable
- Extensible (more features can be added)
- Fresh Pages it should have
- Polite (don't put load on servers of other sites)
